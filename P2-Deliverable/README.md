To Run This Code:

1) First Visit: https://github.com/Pippeloo/DataScience-Paper
2) Download the original dataset "Life Expectancy Dat.csv" and the preprocessed dataset "Life_expectancy_preprocessed.csv"
3) Open the DecisionTree folder and download the "LifeExpectancy_LinearandDecisionTree.ipynb" notebook.
	*The libraries that we used are scikit-learn, numpy, pandas matplotlib, os, subprocess, graphviz,
	pickle, joblib, memory_profiler, time, psutil.*
	**RUN CODE BLOCKS IN ORDER**
